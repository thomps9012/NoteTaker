# NoteTaker

A note saving application that is deployed through heroku (at https://radiant-cliffs-00329.herokuapp.com/). The app allows the user to create and save notes to a SQL database and retrieves the notes using ajax api calls to the database. The notes are then rendered (using a unique note id) in a read only format and the user can then either view or delete the note.
